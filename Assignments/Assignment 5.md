Part 1: 
  a) Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
      - Suppose sqrt(2) is rational, meaning it can be the ratio of 2 integers p and q
      - sqrt(2) = p / q , where we can assume p and q have no common factors.
          - (If any common factors, we cancel in Num and Den)
      - Squaring both sides gives : 2 = p^2 / q^2
      - Implying : p^2 = 2(q^2), therefore p^2 is even and only true if p is even, then p^2 is divisible by 4. 
      - Hence q^2 and therefore q must be even, so p and q are both even.
      - Contradiction to no common factors: both divisible by 2.
      - Therefore sqrt(2) is irrational.
       
  b) If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
      - sqrt(25) = 5; Yes it is a perfect square. The sum of two perfect squares (a^2 + b^2) != 25
  
  c) The sum of two odd integers is even. Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n,
     thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
      - Even = Odd + Odd
      - 2x = (2n + 1) + (2n + 1) 
      - 2x = 4n + 2
      - 2x = 2(2n + 1)
          - ( x = 2n + 1 )
          
      - 2x = 2x , Direct Proof
      
  d) The sum of an even integer and it's square is even: 2x
      - 2n + (2n)^2 = 2x
      - 2n + 4n^2 = 2x
      - 2(n + 2n^2) = 2x
          - ( x = n + 2n^2)
          
      - 2x = 2x , Direct Proof
      
  e) If n squared is odd, then n is odd
      - If n is even, then n^2 is even
      - n = 2k
      - n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
      - n^2 = 2(2k^2), Contraposition
      
      
Part 2: 

 a) ve by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
 b) ve that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3
 Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers 
 Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3 Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
